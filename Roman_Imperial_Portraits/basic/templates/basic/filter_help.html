<h3>Open the filter tab</h3>
<p>Most listviews will have a 'filter' tab. 
  Search the top-right area of the screen for this icon:
  <a class="btn btn-xs jumbo-4" role="button" title="Define your filter(s)...">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search"></span>
  </a>.
  <br />Press the filter icon once to open the filter 'tab' (area to specify filters), and press it again to close that tab.</p>

<h3>Select one or more filters</h3>
<p>The filter tab shows a row of 'selected filters'. 
  <br />
  To actually <em>use</em> one of these filters, press it, so that its color changes to 
  <span class="badge jumbo-3" >green</span>.
</p>
<p>
  The tab may also contain one or more filters that open up a <b>new row</b> of filters.
  <br />
  These 'expansion' filters can be recognized by the three dots '...' at the end of the filter name.
  <br />
  For example: <code>Identity...</code>
</p>
<p>
  The filters come in a limited number of types:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Text</b>:
      Either provide the exact text of what is being looked for (e.g. ancient city <code>Thuburbo Majus</code>), 
      or else use the wildcard <code>*</code> to indicate what you mean (e.g. ancient city <code>*urbo*</code>).
      It is also possible to use a <code>&#35;</code> mark to single out one word or string (e.g. <code>majus#</code>)
    </li>
    <li>A <b>number</b>:
      Provide an integer (whole) number, i.e. one without dot or comma in it.
    </li>
    <li>Item <b>selection</b>:
      Select one or more items from the options provided. Start typing and options will appear. 
      Select an option by either clicking it with the mouse or by pressing the Enter key.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Use the Search button</h3>
<p>
  Once all criteria have been set, use the button <code>Search</code> to start searching.
  The results will be provided in one or more pages (depending on how many results there are).
  Go to a particular page by simply clicking the page number.
</p>
<p>Use the button <code>Clear</code> to clear the search criteria.
  Note that it is still necessary to press <code>Search</code> in order to get the application to provide the complete listview.
